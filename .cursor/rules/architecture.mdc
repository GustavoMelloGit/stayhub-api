- The project follows a clean architecture pattern and Domain Driven Design, separating concerns into the following layers:
  - **`src/domain`**: Contains the core business logic of the application, including entities and repository interfaces.
  - **`src/application`**: Contains the application-specific logic, such as use cases and data transfer objects.
  - **`src/infra`**: Contains the implementation details of the application, such as database repositories, web frameworks, and dependency injection.
  - **`src/presentation`**: Contains the API controllers, which handle incoming HTTP requests and call the appropriate use cases.
- The project uses Bun as the JavaScript runtime and toolkit.
- The project uses TypeScript as the programming language.
- The project uses PostgreSQL as the database.
- The project uses Drizzle as the ORM.
- The project uses Zod as the validation library.

## Creating a new route

- First, check if there is a repository method that can be used to create this new route. If there isn't, create it.
- Then create the use case that will be used to create this new route.
- Then create the controller that will be used to handle the incoming HTTP requests and call the appropriate use case.
- Then add the factory methods to the DI container.
- Then add the route to the routes file.
