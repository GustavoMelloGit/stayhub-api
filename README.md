# StayHub API

This is the backend API for StayHub, a platform for managing property rentals. This project is currently under development.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

### Installing

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GustavoMelloGit/stayhub-api
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd stayhub-api
   ```

### Running the application

1. Start the application using Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```
2. Run the database migrations:
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec api bun run db:migrate
   ```

This will start the development server. The API will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Project Structure

The project follows a clean architecture pattern, separating concerns into the following layers:

- **`src/domain`**: Contains the core business logic of the application, including entities and repository interfaces.
- **`src/application`**: Contains the application-specific logic, such as use cases and data transfer objects.
- **`src/infra`**: Contains the implementation details of the application, such as database repositories, web frameworks, and dependency injection.
- **`src/presentation`**: Contains the API controllers, which handle incoming HTTP requests and call the appropriate use cases.
